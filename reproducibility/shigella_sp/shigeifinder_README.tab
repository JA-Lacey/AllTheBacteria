Shigella species ID and Serotyping (ShigEiFinder)

Tool: Shigeifinder 

Database: Shigeifinder DB

Github: https://github.com/LanLab/ShigEiFinder 

Environment: see file shigeifinder_env.txt 

Command run: 

```bash
cat Shigella_sp.tab | parallel -j 20 --colsep '\t' 'shigeifinder -i {2} --output shigeifinder/{1}_shigeifinder' 
```

Notes on command run: Shigella_sp.tab file was a subset of MLST types known to be shigella from ecoli_achman_4 scheme, this analysis will not have likely found all the shigella genomes. Will need to expand this to be more comphensive.
